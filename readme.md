# Chow Down App

## Introduction
> Chow Down is an app for foodies where users and restaurant owners can
form a community. People are becoming more accustomed to the
idea of reading food reviews and also supplying their own versions aswell.
My idea of creating a central point where restaurant owners can invite
amateur food reviewers or general hungry individuals to their restaurant with
an incentive such as discounts or freebies. In return the food reviewers must
provide a fair review of the restaurant based on these criterias:
- Customer Service,
- Food Quality,
- Atmosphere,
- Photograph,
- Will I Return

>Customer Service, Food Quality, and Atmosphere will be based on a score out of 10. The reason for the rating to be out of 10 instead of 5 is because it is far too easy to score a 4 and be rated as a top class restaurant. The scores will be averaged and a final score provided. The Photograph requirement is to give users and restaurant owners a place to showcase themselves. The Will I Return category will be shown on restaurants details page as "Will I Return / Total reviewers"

>I do believe that businesses want to drive their own successes more and individuals would also be keen to eat with incentives. As a social platform for foodies I do believe the main drivers for the success of this app will be the individual reviewers making it a vibrant place to share their restaurant experience
